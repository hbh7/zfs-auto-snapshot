A customized version of zfs-auto-snapshot for my personal uses, including
fixes for DST, cron running on the hour, specific retention periods, and
some other default options set.

This is a mostly personal-use repo, so I have included very specific things
such as in my cron scripts. They should be obvious and easy enough to tweak 
to your liking if you wanted to use this repo as well.

zfs-auto-snapshot:

An alternative implementation of the zfs-auto-snapshot service for Linux
that is compatible with zfs-linux and zfs-fuse.

Automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic ZFS snapshots. This is
the utility that creates the @zfs-auto-snap_frequent, @zfs-auto-snap_hourly,
@zfs-auto-snap_daily, @zfs-auto-snap_weekly, and @zfs-auto-snap_monthly
snapshots if it is installed.

This program is a posixly correct bourne shell script.  It depends only on
the zfs utilities and cron, and can run in the dash shell.
